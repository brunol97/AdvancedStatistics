This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
dataset = read.csv("student-por.csv", sep = ";", header = TRUE)
glimpse(dataset)
```
```{r}
summary(dataset)
print("hello")
print("omg")
print("fuck")

#import the data
library(readr)
student_por <- read_delim("student-por.csv", 
    delim = ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
View(student_por)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
