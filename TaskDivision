Describing the variables(Steal the original table)

Think of suitable graphs
G3 and Age, stacked bar plot and split sex (M and F)
Linear regression model using all variables except G1 and G2(G3 is outcome)

Interpret results and assess predictive performance

Then for predicitive performance do train/test split(90%/10%?)
Only use the variables that are statistically significant from the original regression. Plot the residuals in a histogram(Fabiana knows how this works)
